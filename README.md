# The Odin Project - Admin Dashboard Project (6)

This project is the second of two projects included in the intermediate HTML and CSS course, second within the full-stack JS developer path. 
The creation of an admin dashboard was requested through extensive use of Grid CSS.
I hope you like my work :)

Tools: HTML / CSS

To Do: Like the rest of The Odin Project projects, this one is not yet responsive (when I reach the learning stage of responsive-web design I will modify the projects built so far).
